Because of corona virus and the other life conditions I had to look at the project a month later. I choose vue to deal with this framework a little more. There were a few compelling points. But after a bit of work I took care of them all.

### To Run

```sh
$ npm run serve
```

### Issues

* [Moment Issue][moment-issue]
* Bootstrap Vue Table doesn't have stacked scope customization. I figured it out lately. I can change the table component with another one but it seems enough for this challenge to me.
